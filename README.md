# flexss (Fitting flexible subject-specific curves)

This is a R package for fitting flexible subject-specific curves when analysing
longitudinal data. Currently, it implements a Bayesian semiparametric model
which allows modelling subject-specific curves as splines.

**This is still a work-in-progress. More details and an accompanying paper will come.**
